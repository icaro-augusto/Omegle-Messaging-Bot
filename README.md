## Description and Features
- This is a secure and effective bot that works using Google Chrome to automate the Omegle website. You can set the message to be sent, the desired interests and the messaging interval, the bot will then open the Omegle website, enter the interests and repeatedly open a new chat, send the message and wait for the desired interval.
- The bot currently supports all types of Proxies: http, socks5 and socks4; with *OR* without authentication.
- The bot supports running multiple different instances, with the same or different settings. If you run several instances without using separate proxies for each, you will get a captcha.
- You can also set the bot to run on headless mode, considerably saving on computer resources.

## Usage Tips
- If you run multiple instances from the same ip address, you will get a captcha, to avoid it, use a proxy.
  - Create either multiple templates with a different proxy on each.
  - Or create a single template, but using a random proxy that assigns a different ip on each connection.
- Set the message interval to at least 5 seconds, setting it lower than that will result in a captcha.
